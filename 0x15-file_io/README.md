# File I/O

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about how to handle files (open, close, read and write), file descriptors, system calls and file permissions in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-read_textfile.c` | Reads a text file and prints it to the `POSIX` standard output |
| `1-create_file.c` | Creates a file |
| `2-append_text_to_file.c` | Appends text at the end of a file |
| `3-cp.c` | Copies the content of a file to another file |
| `100-elf_header.c` | Displays the information contained in the `ELF` header at the start of an `ELF` file |
