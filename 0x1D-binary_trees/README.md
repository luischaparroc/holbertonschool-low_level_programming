# Binary trees

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about what is a binary tree, the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree and the different types of binary trees (complete, full, perfect and balanced).

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
