# Functions, nested loops

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about header files, functions, loops and nested loops in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-holberton.c` | Prints `Holberton` |
| `1-alphabet.c` | Prints the alphabet in lowercase |
| `2-print_alphabet_x10.c` | Prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase |
| `3-islower.c` | Checks for lowercase character |
| `4-isalpha.c` | Checks for alphabetic character |
| `5-sign.c` | Prints the sign of a number |
| `6-abs.c` | Computes the absolute value of an integer |
| `7-print_last_digit.c` | Prints the last digit of a number |
| `8-24_hours.c` | Prints every minute of the day |
| `9-times_table.c` | Prints the 9 times table, starting with 0 |
| `10-add.c` | Adds two integers and returns the result |
| `11-print_to_98.c` | Prints all natural numbers from `n` to `98` |
| `100-times_table.c` | Prints the `n` times table, starting with 0 |
| `101-natural.c` | Computes and prints the sum of all the multiplies of `3` or `5` below `1024` |
| `102-fibonacci.c` | Prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with `1` and `2` |
| `103-fibonacci.c` | Finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms |
| `104-fibonacci.c` | Finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers |
