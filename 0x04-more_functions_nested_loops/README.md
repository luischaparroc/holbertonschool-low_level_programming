# More functions, more nested loops

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about nested loops in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Files
