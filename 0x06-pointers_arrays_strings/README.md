# More pointers, arrays and strings
Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about pointers and arrays in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-strcat.c` | Concatenates two strings |
| `1-strncat.c` | Concatenates two strings, using `n` bytes from `src` |
| `2-strncpy.c` | Copies a string |
| `3-strcmp.c` | Compares two strings |
| `4-rev_array.c` | Reverses the content of an array of integers |
| `5-string_toupper.c` | Changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase |
| `6-cap_string.c` | Capitalizes all words of a string |
| `7-leet.c` | Encodes a string into 1337 |
| `8-rot13.c` | Encodes a string using rot13 |
| `100-print_number.c` | Prints an integer |
| `101-magic.c` | Changes the value of an index of an integer array |
